# hg
A jackbox.tv style game for dumb social media posts.

## Basic TODOs
* [ ] Setup continuous integration and deployment with Docker/Github Actions and AWS
* [ ] Create React frontend (with hooks)
* [ ] Serve app with Node.js/Express running through an NGINX proxy
* [ ] Build all game logic with Node (might use webhooks?)
* [ ] Figure out the right DB to use
